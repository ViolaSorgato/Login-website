# Login-website
This was my second assignment: a simple login/logout webpage.

My array of users that can login:

First username: fredrik
Password: 12345

Second username: charlie
Password: potato

Once logged in, the user's name is displayed.
If the username and password are incorrect, a message will be shown.
